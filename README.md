StarCraft-AI-Bot
================

The aim of this project is to implement a [wall-in](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Walling_as_Terran) algorithm on the bot using [Answer Set Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) with [clasp answer set  solver](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/), and using C++. The problem will be classified as constraint satisfaction problem when clasp solver is used while a different approach will be mantained when using C++.
